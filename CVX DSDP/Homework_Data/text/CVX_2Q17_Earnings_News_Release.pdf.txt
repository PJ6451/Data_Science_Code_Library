Refined product sales of 1.24 million barrels per day decreased 2 percent from second quarter 2016. Branded gasoline sales of 542,000 barrels per day were essentially unchanged from the 2016 period.  Both refinery crude oil input and refined product sales were lower due to divestment of the Hawaii refining and marketing assets in fourth quarter 2016.
