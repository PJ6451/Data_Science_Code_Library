Our operational performance in the third quarter was strong. Our refineries continued to run well and Tengizchevroil completed the largest turnaround in its history ahead of schedule and under budget. We have had steady LNG production and cargo shipments from Gorgon Train 1, and we recently started LNG production from Gorgon Train 2. In light of these milestones, we expect December production between 2.65-2.70 million barrels per day in oil-  have made progress toward our goals of lowering the cash breakeven in our upstream business and added. Capital spending and operating and administrative expenses have been reduced by over $10 billion from the first nine months of 2015 as a result of a series of deliberate actions we have taken. $0.01 per share increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.08 per share, payable in December 2016.
